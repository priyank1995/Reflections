1. Remote repository comes handy when we got to share our work or work collaboratively.
2. Manually pulls will pull more meaning full commits.
3. Clone : This is done when we colne or download the remoterepository to our local machine.
   Fork : Done when we colne repo from one git account to our git account but not to our local machine.
   Branch : This is done on ringle repo. We spilt a branch out of one. 
4. Last known remote copy should be stored locally so that the changes made by other people are also available to us atleast up to the time when the remote-master was fetched.
